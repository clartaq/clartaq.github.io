      <description>Ya know, this point just keeps slapping me in the face. It seems that people don&amp;rsquo;t stop trying to use Lisp because they don&amp;rsquo;t like the language. A lot of people stop because they don&amp;rsquo;t like the programming environment. Looking around the Q&amp;amp;A sites there seem to be many more questions about setting up a programming environment for the Lisp family of languages than there are for the more mainstream languages like Java and C++.</description>

      <title>Getting enclojure 1.4 to work</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;del&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.enclojure.org&#34;&gt;enclojure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Dead Link&lt;/strong&gt;) for a long time (in internet years). It has always seemed a bit finicky. However, with the 1.4 release and the switch to using &lt;a href=&#34;http://maven.apache.org&#34;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; as the build tool, things stopped working. Projects that had worked fine before no longer compiled or executed. The &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; section of the enclojure web page appears to be hopelessly out of date and actually misleading. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I had to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
