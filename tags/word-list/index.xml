      <description>A little word game that I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing requires a list of acceptable words. For the game, acceptable words should be defined similarly to popular word games the player already knows like ScrabbleÂ® or Words with Friends. Luckily word lists for such games are readily available.
For my little game, the list from Words with Friends seemed like the best choice. But it has about 175,000 English words. Way to many to use routinely in development.</description>
