      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it. I&amp;rsquo;m an infrequent blogger. But I&amp;rsquo;m not an infrequent writer. So why does the (vast) majority of what I write never make it onto the blog?
The answer is friction. And why is that? Here is my process.
 Think of something that I want to write down so I remember it. Realize that what I&amp;rsquo;ve written might be useful to someone else too. (It could happen!) Look at what I have to do in order to get my thoughts from my editor to the blog.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit of a slog, but things should be up and running again. The transition was a bit harder than expected.
Here are some things you should know:
 The site is generated by the Hugo static site generator. The site uses a trivial modification of the very pleasant Blackburn theme. There are still some kinks I want to work out, but it is very useful overall. The repository for the site is on GitHub here and is generated from the information in the repository here.</description>
