      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of the programs I write need a way to enter and edit a two-dimensional grid of data in the user interface. Such a grid doesn&#39;t need to be a full-fledged spreadsheet, just provide flexible data entry and editing. Alas, there doesn&#39;t seem to be such a thing and I haven&#39;t created one that I&#39;m satisfied with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I wrote a post about &amp;ldquo;spare time&amp;rdquo; projects &amp;ndash; programming projects undertaken to learn something new, try something out, see how something works. These are activities undertaken to improve your skills and, maybe, scratch an itch that&#39;s been bothering you. These projects aren&#39;t typically related to work.
In the past few days, Oren Eini (aka Ayende Rahien) wrote a couple of posts expressing the opinion that if you don&#39;t do such projects, he probably doesn&#39;t want to hire you.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s pretty common to see discussions about how to determine if a candidate for a programming job has a &amp;ldquo;passion&amp;rdquo; for programming and software. One of the usual pieces of advice is to ask about the projects someone does in their &amp;ldquo;spare time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
