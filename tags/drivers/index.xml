      <description>After my many re-installations of Windows 7, I often have an &amp;ldquo;Unknown Device&amp;rdquo; in the list of USB devices shown by the Windows Device Manager. It is almost always because of my LogiTech G110 keyboard. It works as a USB keyboard with no additional setup after these re-installations, but its extra functionality (like the cool lighted key caps) require that the device driver be installed. Doing so invariably removes the last &amp;ldquo;Unknown Device&amp;rdquo; warning from the device list.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since the purchase of a nice new system running Windows 7 Professional, I have been plagued by periodic system crashes. Crashes that make the system unstable and that finally make it unbootable. And it&amp;rsquo;s all the fault of Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;
