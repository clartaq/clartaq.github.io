      <description>I wanted to add an estimate of words and characters in wiki pages for a program I am writing CWiki There was some guidance on this topic (in Python) here.
Of course the original Markdown.pl was a good source for matching regular expressions too.
What follows is a copy of the &amp;ldquo;seed page&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;About the Word Count&amp;rdquo; from the CWiki wiki program:

Up at the top of each page, below the author and creation/modification dates, there is a line showing the number of characters in the page along with an estimate of the number of words in the page.</description>
