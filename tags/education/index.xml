      <description>Programming is one of the few professions where you regularly see self-taught practitioners. They have little or no formal education in the subject, but they often do quite well. In some cases, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with some who were considered outstanding in their area of focus, like machine control or real-time.
Granted, early in their careers, these folks often produce nasty messes that happen to work well enough but are simply not maintainable or not extendable.</description>
