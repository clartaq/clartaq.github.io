      <description>Doing some experimenting with the Scheme programming language recently has been a lot of fun. It&amp;rsquo;s even simpler in most ways than Clojure.
As part of that experimentation, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into implementing a simple, terminal-based text editor along the lines of kilo by following along with the tutorial series &amp;ldquo;Build Your Own Text Editor&amp;rdquo;.
Working through those tutorials, one of the first things that smacks you in the face is just how low-level the C programming language is and how very different it feels when compared to Scheme or, really, any other Lisp variant.</description>
