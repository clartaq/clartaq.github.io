      <description>As some of you know, we&#39;ve spent the last several months moving around looking for a nice place to settle down. That&#39;s finished. We&#39;re now in Salem, Virginia.
Before starting that search, we bought a laptop to take over the duties of the desktop. On the night before we left Tucson, I dumped a cup of water on it and fried the keyboard and other parts. It turns out the model was too new to get replacement parts.</description>

      <description>My wife and I have birthdays that are just a few days apart. This year we ended up getting each other an iPad 2. We have an iMac but have never bought into the whole iPod, iPhone, iThis&#39;nThat thing.
We were really excited to get started playing with our new toys. They came in nice boxes with the needed accessories, but little else including any guide on how to get started.</description>
