      <description>Medical procedures are not always completely satisfactory. However, from my own experience, cataract surgery can be extremely beneficial.
Last year, vision in one of my eyes was becoming quite blurry. Vision in the other eye was deteriorating as well. I&#39;ve known for years that I had small cataracts in one eye even though I am relatively young. (I blame chemotherapy several years ago, but who really knows.)
A visit to the ophthalmologist confirmed that my cataracts were growing rather quickly.</description>
