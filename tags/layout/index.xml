      <description>Update: 2018-12-15 This post substantially updates the original. The most significant changes are that the layout now works as expected - no partial success.
A few weeks ago, I wrote a post about a wiki layout for reading. I used that project to experiment with improvements to the reading view of CWiki, a personal wiki that I am writing. I used the lessons learned in the project described in that post to make some changes to CWiki.</description>

      <description>â€‹As many of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a personal wiki for some time now. (See the CWiki repository.) In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m using it to write this post. It&amp;rsquo;s very comfortable for me.
One of the things I have been trying to get absolutely right (for me at least) is the layout. There are really only two layouts; one is for the &amp;ldquo;reading&amp;rdquo; view, the other for the &amp;ldquo;editing&amp;rdquo; view.</description>
