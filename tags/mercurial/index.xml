      <description>With the recent announcement that Bitbucket is &amp;ldquo;sunsetting&amp;rdquo; Mercurial support, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at ways of hosting remote copies of my repositories on my own.
In the short term, I have just cloned my repositories from Bitbucket onto a Raspberry Pi 4 sitting behind my home desktop. I use Pi to run a River of News aggregator for my family. It has plenty of capacity for a task like this.</description>

      <description>As a lone developer, I have a workflow that I believe is pretty typical.
Most of my development work happens on the &amp;ldquo;tip&amp;rdquo; of the &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; branch. It&amp;rsquo;s just easier to do work on fixing small bugs or adding minor features there.
For more significant, more difficult pieces of work, I usually create a &amp;ldquo;feature branch.&amp;rdquo; I do this with the expectation that if things get messed up too badly, I can delete the branch and start over without affecting the readiness of the default branch.</description>
