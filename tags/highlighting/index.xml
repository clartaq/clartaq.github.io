      <description>Update 2017-08-19: This post refers to a time when the blog was hosted in WordPress. It isn&#39;t really applicable anymore. But it may provide some guidance to someone who happens to come across it.
Since this blog is mostly about programming, there are a lot of code listings. To make those listings more easily readable, highlighting syntax in the listings is a good thing.
Of all of the syntax highlighters I have tried, the SyntaxHighlighter JavaScript tool by Alex Gorbachev is the one I most prefer.</description>
