      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been away awhile, working on a new project. It&#39;s part of an educational effort about molecular dynamics simulation. Although I&#39;ve been working a lot with Clojure using emacs for editing, this project required a return to Java. As a result, I&#39;ve been using NetBeans again. The difference in productivity was amazing and not in the way I expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been updating some of my projects to use the newly released Java 8. That includes many Clojure projects. These are just &amp;ldquo;flow of consciousness&amp;rdquo; debugging notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Clojure Development Toolchain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things about &lt;a href=&#34;http://clojure.org/&#34;&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; that is difficult for beginners is the process of creating and running programs. I would argue that it is more difficult than learning the language itself. There is no &amp;ldquo;one-button&amp;rdquo; provisioning system that would set up some sort of canonical development environment. This long post will talk about setting up Leiningen and Emacs to make a comfortable environment for developing in Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Lisp/Scheme/Clojure</title>

      <description>Ya know, this point just keeps slapping me in the face. It seems that people don&#39;t stop trying to use Lisp because they don&#39;t like the language. A lot of people stop because they don&#39;t like the programming environment. Looking around the Q&amp;amp;A sites there seem to be many more questions about setting up a programming environment for the Lisp family of languages than there are for the more mainstream languages like Java and C++.</description>
