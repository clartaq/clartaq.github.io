      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Lou the Luddite&amp;rdquo; blog was originally created as a self-hosted WordPress blog. But this blog was always a bit problematic for some reason. At first, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get automatic WordPress updates to work. Then I found EasyEngine, which did the install for me and got things running. But it&amp;rsquo;s just a big black box of a script. I don&amp;rsquo;t know all of the details of what it does. That isn&amp;rsquo;t something I&amp;rsquo;m really comfortable with.</description>
