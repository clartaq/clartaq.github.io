      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every programmer seems to have their own list of favorite programming books. The lists are very personal and seem to be influenced by the age of the programmer, their training, and their field of endeavor. My own list follows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Ya know, this point just keeps slapping me in the face. It seems that people don&amp;rsquo;t stop trying to use Lisp because they don&amp;rsquo;t like the language. A lot of people stop because they don&amp;rsquo;t like the programming environment. Looking around the Q&amp;amp;A sites there seem to be many more questions about setting up a programming environment for the Lisp family of languages than there are for the more mainstream languages like Java and C++.</description>

      <description>Note: This is a re-post of an earlier entry recovered from a different blogging system.
After entering and running the evolution.lisp example fromÂ Land of Lisp, I have some ideas for additional traits.
Here are a few.
 Size, Carnivorous Animals. Add a feature to allow the animals to be of different sizes. Larger animals would expend energy faster. When two animals occupy, the same cell, the larger would try to eat the smaller, taking it&amp;rsquo;s energy.</description>
