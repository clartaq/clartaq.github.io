      <description>For the past few months, I&#39;ve been beating my head against a brick wall. The problem was that I was trying to get an all-server-side wiki built using Clojure.
It actually works pretty well. I&#39;ve been using it for personal information for months now. It works well except for one aspect, arguably the most important &amp;ndash; editing new or existing content is not that pleasant.
It&#39;s all a variation of Markdown, which is nice.</description>
