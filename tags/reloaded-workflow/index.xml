      <description>Starting the implementation of user options (preferences) in CWiki (a personal wiki program) got me thinking about refactoring the project into a shape that is more compatible with Stuart Sierras reloaded workflow.

 Stuart has a blog post about his reloaded workflow, linked above. The component code repository is on Github here.</description>
