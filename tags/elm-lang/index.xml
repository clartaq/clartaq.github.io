      <description>The Elm language is often cited as an up-and-comer for web front end development. I was attracted to it largely because of the compiler&amp;rsquo;s friendly and extremely helpful error messages. It&amp;rsquo;s really attractive in many ways.
But when I started looking at examples, I often found myself thinking things like &amp;ldquo;Why is this so inconsistent?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Why is this syntax so complicated?&amp;rdquo;. And it finally occurred to me that I&amp;rsquo;ve been ruined by the way Clojure/ClojureScript/Lisp/Scheme do things.</description>
