      <description>Feeling a bit frustrated today, so I thought I would just vent a bit.
Iâ€™ve been working on some personal tools. I see some things in other tools that I would like to include in my own. I keep finding that those features that I like are written in JavaScript with that whole mess of an ecosystem. When I look for something similar in Java/JavaFX I find next to nothing.</description>

      <title>De-Activating My Evernote Account</title>

      <description>It was very unpleasant for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a user of Evernote almost from the beginning, and a Premium user for almost as long. But today I erased all of my notes and deactivated my account. &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; you might ask. Let me tell you.
 The price increase. Earlier in the Autumn, Evernote announced a price increase. It was pretty substantial, at least for me. At about the same time, they announced that they were moving our data to Google&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure in order to take advantage of improved economies of scale among other reasons.</description>

      <title>JavaFX Still Not Ready?</title>

      <description>Just a short rant about JavaFX because I&amp;rsquo;m pissed about it at the moment. I enjoy using it for the most part but it sometimes throws up surprising obstacles in otherwise routine work. The latest for me was an unexpected lack of a spinner control. There are alternatives in some open source projects, but, really? No spinners built in?
This is almost as gob-smacking weird as the lack of dialogs. (Ok, there are some dialogs, like for opening/saving files, but not much in the way of user-programmable dialogs built in.</description>
