      <description>As has been noted before, Arizona contains enough photogenic scenery that even I get a nice photo now and then. Here&amp;rsquo;s one that has been manipulated a bit into a nice abstract background for blogs or program windows.
This was taken at the Bryce-Thompson Arboretum in Florence Arizona in the Autumn of 2010. The photo originated as a snapshot of a rock covered with a bluish-gray lichen and a rather bright green moss.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty rare for photos to be included on this blog. But it&amp;rsquo;s even rarer to see snow here in Tucson. So here are a few pics of what we woke up to this morning.
Snow-Covered Palms at the Side of our House
Our palm trees are not really used to this!
If you&amp;rsquo;re a golf fan, you are probably aware that the Accenture Golf Tournament is being played here. This is a view over toward the town of Marana.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arizona, where I live, has a lot of very photogenic scenery. I am by no means a very talented photographer, but with all the opportunities around here, every once in a while, even I manage to snap a nice image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
